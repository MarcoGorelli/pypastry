PyPastry - the opinionated machine learning experimentation framework
=====================================================================

PyPastry is a framework for developers and data scientists to run
machine learning experiments. We enable you to:

 - Iterate quickly. The more experiments you do, the more likely you
   are to find something that works well.
 - Experiment correctly and consistently. Anything else is not really
   an experiment, is it?
 - Make experiments reproducible. That means keeping track of your
   code state and results.
 - Experiment locally. None of that Spark rubbish.
 - Use standard tools. Everything is based on Scikit-learn, Pandas and Git.
